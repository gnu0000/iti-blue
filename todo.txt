Elephant todo:
--------------

1> Be more strict on accepting policies
    ex: [RWRWRW]
    ex: [RWRWRW]junk <--- works but shouldn't
    ex: [RWRWRW]date,[RWRWRW] <--- works but not as expected

2> Be fully case sensitive

3> Include Policy2 and policy change in bucket xml (currently,
they only show up in the headers)


4> support an acronym type for Timed Locks.  something like:
  old: [.W.W..],2008-11-22 11:00:00,[R.....]
  new: TimeLock,2008-11-22 11:00:00

5> Update the online docs


6> Expose the admin pages

7> Apache error log shows:
[Fri May 16 11:26:36 2008] [error] [client 172.20.1.103] DBD::mysql::st
execute failed: Unknown column 'user_agent' in 'field list' at
../lib/Blue/DB.pm line 152.

8> Ability to query resources

9> ignore extra / in the resource uris 
Example: 
interpret https://elephant.bidx.com/namespace//bucket as
https://elephant.bidx.com/namespace/bucket

10> API for user management. (For example BidderServer might want to create a
new elephant user when ever a new user is created on BidderServer)
